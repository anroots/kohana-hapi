# Kohana HAPI

**H**yperText Transfer Protocol **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface

The purpose of this module is to provide an easy framework for API-based development projects.

**In development. Do not use.** It is expected that the major (backwards incompatible) versions will be increased rapidly.

## What it is

* Framework for adding API support to your Kohana project
* Unfinished

## What it is not

* RESTful - Well, a bit, but missing [level three of the API maturity model](http://www.crummy

* General purpose
* Scalable and optimized - mean for one server, one client approach where client is under vendor control
* Tested

# TODO

* Remove some of the hardcoded values to support not only JSON
* Document code, wiki, gh-pages
* Improve architecture
* Improve API semantics: provide meaningful error and status messages in response body
* Work towards achieving REST
